    <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Bread Flour</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on the counter <br>
            for about 5 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to prevent sticking. <br>
            This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make <br>
            your pizza crust tough. Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of olive oil <br>
             and maybe a little bit of flour. This will prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a 
             gorgeous golden color.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in the air, use a rolling pin, <br>
            or pat it with your hands. No matter which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. <br>
            Working it too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should have an even circle that's <br>
            about 10 to 12 inches wide and about â…“-inch thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support 
            the sauce and toppings.
        </li>
    </ul>
