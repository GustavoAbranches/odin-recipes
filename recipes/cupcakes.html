    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). <br>
            Line a standard muffin tin with 12 paper cupcake liners. <br>
            Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl; set aside.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Heat the butter and milk in a small saucepan over low heat until the butter has melted. <br>
            Beat the sugar, eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until <br>
            it has thickened slightly and is lighter in color. Gradually beat in the flour mixture on <br>
            low speed until just incorporated. Slowly pour in the hot milk, beating until just combined.

            Divide batter evenly between cupcake liners. Bake until toothpick inserted into center comes <br>
            out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool cupcakes in pan for 10 minutes. Transfer cupcakes to a <br>
            cooling rack to cool completely.
